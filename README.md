# unique-username-finder

Creates random usersnames, checks against Google for zero results returned

## Usage

Install Python 3.x. Run the file with `python main.py`.

It'll (over)write the results to `results.txt`.

The code's super ugly and hacked together, but it got the job done.

Output will look something like:
