# unique-username-finder

Creates random usernames, checks against Google for zero results returned

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.x
1. Run the file with `python main.py i` where `i` is the number of usernames you want to attempt to generate (the actual number will be smaller, as non-unique ones -- those found to have google results -- will be filtered out)

It'll (over)write the results to `results.txt`.

Output will look something like:

    Checking [ 10 ] usernames

    Checked 10 usernames
    3 usernames were found to be unique
    Username generation took this much time: 0:00:04.818727
